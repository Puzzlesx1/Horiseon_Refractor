# Horiseon Refractor

This challenge was used to help me better understand HTML and CSS. I was expected to update the current code to meet accesbility standards.

While refractoring the code and consolidating certain CSS elements, I noticed that some functions (text/images) would become harder to read as the window size decreased. This was mainly due to all aspects of the site staying the same no matter the size of the window. To fix this I added in some minor changes to CSS code allowing for changes of texts/images with the decrease or increase in the window size

Overall this helped me better understand certain aspects of the code and the importance of making sure the code is clean and notated.
